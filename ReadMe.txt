QUAKE 4: GottaGoFast (Sonic the hedgehog inspired) Mod

Deliverables:

1. Sonic the hedgehog damage system with rings.

2. Item replacements for rings scattered around the stage.

3. Sonic powerups (Invincibility, Super speed, shield) scattered around the level.

4. Bonus level for having a certain amount of rings at the end of a stage. 

How to play:

The ring system in this Mod makes it so that you have to collect rings (health packs)
to stay alive. Each health pack is worth 1 ring. They will be scattered around the stage
for you to collect and add to your ring counter. Whenever you take damage, you lose all
rings you currently have. Once taking damage, you will become invincible temporarily and
your rings will scatter around you, giving you a chance to pick them up.
If you take damage while having 0 rings, you will die.

Armor packs will act as your powerups for this mod. Once picked up you gain a temporary
buff. These will also be scattered around the stage as well.
They are split up into 3 categories:
invincibility, super speed, and shield.

invincibility: Become invincible for a short time and take no damage.

super speed: Base walking speed increased dramatically for a short period.

shield: You can take 1 hit without losing any rings or dying. Once hit, the shield will
be gone.

Collecting 50 rings when reaching the end of the stage gives you the option to try a
bonus stage! You will be able to play a race-to-the-finish mini-game by going through
a special map.

**NOTE** 
Only the first deliverable is complete. Others are either incomplete or 
did not have time to be implemented into this version of the mod.
